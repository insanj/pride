## About

Pride is a lightweight Minecraft mod that helps everyone on a Bukkit/Spigot server keep track of each other. Although relatively simple in its design, Pride aims to be really useful and offer a nice supplement to the built-in navigation features of Minecraft.

Pride will be open sourced at version 1.0!

### 0.3.x Features

- Create "Pride areas", which represent the area where you are located (by default 50 blocks large, but can be configured in the `config.yml`)
- Detect when entering a "Pride area" and send a message to the server
- List, remove, and calculate distance from "Pride areas"

## Playing

- `/pride`
- `/settle <name>`
- `/abandon <name>`
- `/far <name>`
- `/here <optional:username>`
- `/between <name_1>, <name_2>`
- `/compass <optional:area>`

### Example config.yml
```YAML
initialized: true
distance: 50
worlds:
  75310a3a-6bb4-4e0c-8409-9e6648ac7f3e:
    Ocean Monument Entrance: -1287.35,29.56,-7453.77
    Birch & Brick: -593.27,83.00,-4818.50
    Cottage on the Cliff of the Icebergs: -910.49,74.00,-7357.35
    Chicken Farm: -705.96,67.00,-8065.75
```

## Building

Pride was not built using Eclipse or any other IDE. Although you can use one, the instructions below are for building and running this plugin with only the command line and a few easy to understand tools.

### Requirements

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download) to run the [makefile](https://github.com/insanj/pride/blob/master/makefile), although each command inside this file can be ran on its own
- [spigot](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot)`.jar` or `bukkit.jar` version **1.13.2** or above, currently expected in a local `server/` directory
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 10 or above, required for `javac` and `jar` to run

> NOTE: Make sure the Java version on your server and the Java version on the machine that builds Pride are the same, otherwise Bukkit/Spitgot will not allow it to run.

### Commands

#### `make plugin`
- cleans `build/`
- compiles the `plugin/` directory
- builds a `.jar`
- moves it into `server/plugins/` for use in the Spigot/Bukkit server

#### `make server`
- launches the server
